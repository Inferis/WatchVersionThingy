## WatchkitVersionDemo  

This repo is companion source code for a [blogpost](http://blog.inferis.org/blog/2015/05/11/watchkit-app-versions/), which in itself is a followup to a [blogpost by Daniel Kennett](http://ikennd.ac/blog/2015/05/build-time-cfbundleversion-values-in-watchkit-apps/).

This demo project contains a simpler approach to the problem Daniel described, although it still is no walk in the park.
